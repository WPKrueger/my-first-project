# About my first project on Github

This is not a professional project, it doesn't serve any purpose, and it will most likely be chaotic. This project will contain all the code I created during my very first exposure to the world of coding. For this project I will add everything I make that is interesting or creative, as well as bits of code that I find to be especially helpful in my learning experience.
